Arduino INO files for ESP32 glider dongles. Uses serial, BT (for ESP32 boards that support it), BLE and Wifi to receive, combine, and send data to and from flight instruments and computers (eg. phone, kobo, vario, FLARM/SoftRF, etc.)

Presently, each version is hard-coded for the specific pilot/glider requirements and ESP32 board being used.
